                We cover real-world events and real people. Our work interprets the news using satire, exaggeration,
                irony, and parody to provide social and political commentary. It is intended to be humorous and
                thoughtâ€‘provoking rather than read as literal reporting.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-red mb-2">Satirical Content</h3>
              <p class="lh-1-6 mb-3">
                Our articles, headlines, and imagery often amplify, compress, or reframe real statements and events for
                comedic and critical effect. While grounded in reality, pieces are satirical, exaggerated, and ironic.
                They are intended as commentary and humor, not verbatim accounts.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-red mb-2">Representation of Facts</h3>
              <p class="lh-1-6 mb-3">
                Coverage may include paraphrases, composite scenarios, or dramatized details that express a point of
                view. Quotes not presented as direct citations should be understood as satirical reconstructions.
                Names of public figures may appear in a satirical context; any embellishments are used to highlight the
                underlying reality through irony and humor.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-red mb-2">Opinion and Commentary</h3>
