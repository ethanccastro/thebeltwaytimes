                        Welcome to the most "reliable" news source you'll ever find on the internet (and that's saying something). We're not your typical news outlet – we're the kind that makes you question whether you should laugh, cry, or just stare blankly at your screen wondering what just happened.
                    </p>

                        <h3 class="text-red mb-2">Our Mission</h3>
                        <p class="lh-1-6 mb-3">
                            In a world where truth is stranger than fiction, we've decided to embrace the chaos with open arms and a healthy dose of sarcasm. Our mission is simple: to deliver the news with a side of irony so thick you could spread it on toast.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-red mb-2">What We Do</h3>
                        <p class="lh-1-6 mb-3">
                            We take the day's most absurd headlines and give them the treatment they deserve – because sometimes the best way to understand the world is to laugh at it. Our team of "journalists" (we use that term loosely) scours the internet for stories that make us question our collective sanity, then presents them with the seriousness they absolutely don't warrant.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-red mb-2">Our Editorial Standards</h3>
                        <p class="lh-1-6 mb-3">
                            • Fact-checking: We fact-check our facts with other facts (when we remember to)<br>
                            • Objectivity: We're completely objective about how subjective everything is<br>
                            • Accuracy: We're accurate about 73.6% of the time (we made up that statistic)<br>
                            • Ethics: We follow the highest journalistic standards of the 19th century
                        </p>
