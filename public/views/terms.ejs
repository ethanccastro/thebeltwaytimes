                                The Beltway Times provides social and political commentary through satire, exaggeration,
                                irony, and parody. Our articles, headlines, and imagery often amplify, compress, or
                                reframe real statements and events for comedic and critical effect. While grounded in
                                reality, our work is intended to be humorous and thought-provoking, not read as literal
                                reporting.
